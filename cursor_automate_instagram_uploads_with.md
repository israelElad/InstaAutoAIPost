**User**

I'd like to create a script that would take the least-recent taken photo from photos that the user already uploaded to some storage, and post it on instagram, then delete the photo from S3. The script should run at specific times per day. It should handle failures and exceptions.
It should scan the images if any images were added to determine if all images are within Instagram requirements, or otherwise print an error.
The script should be well structured (separate files, Single Responsibility principle for functions and all other good coding principles...), and contain unit tests.
Feel free to suggest alternatives, but I was thinking of making a Python script which uses intagrapi, packing it in a Docker container, run on AWS lambda and use its schedualer, and use S3 as the storage that the user will upload the images to.
The whole thing should only use free tiers, no payment required.
Make sure everything is safe and secure (e.g. the container's content isn't exposed, no unsafe code or exposed tokens or account info...)
Also describe and document the process as you go, as I want to upload the project to Github/Medium.
Overall I have a bunch of images I'd like to upload daily (or a few times a day at specific hours) to instagram but I don't want to do it manually.
Bonus: Use some free AI (or at least free for limited use as I don't plan on uploading a lot of images) to auto analyse the picture before uploading and add a description and tags to the post that will describe the picture and attract the most possible views.
Thanks!

I'll help you create a well-structured Instagram automation project that meets your requirements. Let's break this down into steps and create a robust solution. First, let's set up the project structure and create the necessary files.

Let me first check if there's any existing code in the workspace.



Great, we're starting with a clean workspace. Let's create a well-structured Python project. I'll create the following structure:

1. First, let's create a `requirements.txt` with our dependencies:


```plaintext
instagrapi==2.0.1
boto3==1.34.34
python-dotenv==1.0.1
Pillow==10.2.0
pytest==8.0.2
requests==2.31.0
python-dateutil==2.8.2
```

Now, let's create a README.md with project documentation:


```markdown
# Instagram Auto Poster

An automated solution for posting images to Instagram from an S3 bucket. This project uses AWS Lambda and EventBridge to schedule posts at specific times throughout the day.

## Features

- Automatically posts the least-recent image from an S3 bucket to Instagram
- Validates images against Instagram requirements
- Handles failures and exceptions gracefully
- Uses AWS Lambda and EventBridge for scheduling
- Implements secure credential management
- Includes comprehensive unit tests
- Uses free tier services only

## Architecture

The solution consists of the following components:

1. **S3 Bucket**: Stores images to be posted
2. **AWS Lambda**: Runs the posting script on schedule
3. **EventBridge**: Schedules the Lambda function
4. **Docker Container**: Packages the Lambda function
5. **Instagram API**: Handles posting to Instagram

## Setup

1. Create an S3 bucket for storing images
2. Set up AWS Lambda with the provided Docker container
3. Configure EventBridge rules for scheduling
4. Set up environment variables for credentials

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. Build Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t instagram-auto-poster .
   ```

## Security Considerations

- All credentials are stored as environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in the code
- Secure handling of Instagram credentials
- Proper error handling and logging
- Input validation and sanitization

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

Now, let's create the project structure and implement the core functionality. First, let's create the necessary directories:


I apologize for the Windows-specific command issue. Let's create the directories one by one:


Now let's create the core files. First, let's create the configuration file:


```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Instagram credentials
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME = os.getenv('INSTAGRAM_USERNAME')
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD = os.getenv('INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD')

# AWS credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
S3_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('S3_BUCKET_NAME')

# Instagram image requirements
INSTAGRAM_MIN_ASPECT_RATIO = 0.8
INSTAGRAM_MAX_ASPECT_RATIO = 1.91
INSTAGRAM_MIN_RESOLUTION = 320
INSTAGRAM_MAX_RESOLUTION = 1440
INSTAGRAM_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 8

# Error messages
ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'missing_credentials': 'Missing required credentials in environment variables',
    'invalid_image': 'Image does not meet Instagram requirements',
    'upload_failed': 'Failed to upload image to Instagram',
    's3_error': 'Error accessing S3 bucket',
    'instagram_error': 'Error with Instagram API',
}

def validate_config():
    """Validate that all required environment variables are set."""
    required_vars = [
        'INSTAGRAM_USERNAME',
        'INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD',
        'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
        'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
        'S3_BUCKET_NAME'
    ]
    
    missing_vars = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]
    
    if missing_vars:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required environment variables: {', '.join(missing_vars)}")
```

Now, let's create the image validator utility:


```python
from PIL import Image
import io
from ..config import (
    INSTAGRAM_MIN_ASPECT_RATIO,
    INSTAGRAM_MAX_ASPECT_RATIO,
    INSTAGRAM_MIN_RESOLUTION,
    INSTAGRAM_MAX_RESOLUTION,
    INSTAGRAM_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB
)

class ImageValidationError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for image validation errors."""
    pass

def validate_image(image_data: bytes) -> bool:
    """
    Validate if the image meets Instagram requirements.
    
    Args:
        image_data (bytes): The image data to validate
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the image meets all requirements
        
    Raises:
        ImageValidationError: If the image doesn't meet requirements
    """
    try:
        # Check file size
        if len(image_data) > INSTAGRAM_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB * 1024 * 1024:
            raise ImageValidationError(f"Image size exceeds {INSTAGRAM_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB}MB limit")
        
        # Open image and get dimensions
        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data))
        width, height = image.size
        
        # Check minimum resolution
        if width < INSTAGRAM_MIN_RESOLUTION or height < INSTAGRAM_MIN_RESOLUTION:
            raise ImageValidationError(f"Image resolution below minimum {INSTAGRAM_MIN_RESOLUTION}x{INSTAGRAM_MIN_RESOLUTION}")
        
        # Check maximum resolution
        if width > INSTAGRAM_MAX_RESOLUTION or height > INSTAGRAM_MAX_RESOLUTION:
            raise ImageValidationError(f"Image resolution exceeds maximum {INSTAGRAM_MAX_RESOLUTION}x{INSTAGRAM_MAX_RESOLUTION}")
        
        # Check aspect ratio
        aspect_ratio = width / height
        if aspect_ratio < INSTAGRAM_MIN_ASPECT_RATIO or aspect_ratio > INSTAGRAM_MAX_ASPECT_RATIO:
            raise ImageValidationError(
                f"Image aspect ratio {aspect_ratio:.2f} outside allowed range "
                f"[{INSTAGRAM_MIN_ASPECT_RATIO:.2f}, {INSTAGRAM_MAX_ASPECT_RATIO:.2f}]"
            )
        
        return True
        
    except ImageValidationError:
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        raise ImageValidationError(f"Error validating image: {str(e)}")
```

Now, let's create the S3 service:


```python

Now, let's create the Instagram service:


```python

Now, let's create the Lambda handler:


```python

            }
        
        # Post to Instagram
        try:
            instagram_service.post_image(image_data)
        except Exception as e:

                'message': f'Unexpected error: {str(e)}'
            })
        }
```

Now, let's create a test file for the image validator:


```python
import pytest
from PIL import Image
import io
from src.utils.image_validator import validate_image, ImageValidationError

def create_test_image(width: int, height: int) -> bytes:
    """Create a test image with specified dimensions."""
    image = Image.new('RGB', (width, height), color='red')
    img_byte_arr = io.BytesIO()
    image.save(img_byte_arr, format='JPEG')
    return img_byte_arr.getvalue()

def test_valid_image():
    """Test validation of a valid image."""
    # Create a valid image (800x800)
    image_data = create_test_image(800, 800)
    assert validate_image(image_data) is True

def test_invalid_resolution():
    """Test validation of an image with invalid resolution."""
    # Create an image that's too small
    image_data = create_test_image(200, 200)

def test_invalid_aspect_ratio():
    """Test validation of an image with invalid aspect ratio."""
    # Create an image with invalid aspect ratio
    image_data = create_test_image(1000, 100)

        validate_image(image_data)

def test_large_file():
    """Test validation of an image that's too large."""
    # Create a large image (2000x2000)
    image_data = create_test_image(2000, 2000)
    with pytest.raises(ImageValidationError):
        validate_image(image_data)

def test_invalid_image_data():
    """Test validation of invalid image data."""
    with pytest.raises(ImageValidationError):
        validate_image(b'invalid image data')
```

Finally, let's create the Dockerfile:


```dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.9

# Copy requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}

# Install the specified packages
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy function code
COPY src/ ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/src/

# Set the CMD to your handler
CMD [ "src.handlers.lambda_handler.lambda_handler" ]
```

Let me explain the project structure and how to use it:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - `src/`: Contains the main application code
     - `handlers/`: Contains the Lambda handler
     - `services/`: Contains the S3 and Instagram services
     - `utils/`: Contains utility functions like image validation
     - `config.py`: Configuration and environment variables
   - `tests/`: Contains unit tests
   - `Dockerfile`: For containerizing the application
   - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

2. **Setup Instructions**:

   a. Create an S3 bucket in AWS:
   - Go to AWS S3 console
   - Create a new bucket
   - Note down the bucket name

   b. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
   INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
   ```

   c. Build and deploy the Lambda function:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t instagram-auto-poster .

   # Push to ECR (you'll need to create an ECR repository first)
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name instagram-auto-poster
   aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-account-id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
   docker tag instagram-auto-poster:latest your-account-id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/instagram-auto-poster:latest
   docker push your-account-id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/instagram-auto-poster:latest
   ```

   d. Create the Lambda function:
   - Go to AWS Lambda console
   - Create a new function
   - Choose "Container image"
   - Select the image you pushed to ECR
   - Set the environment variables from your `.env` file

   e. Set up EventBridge (CloudWatch Events):
   - Go to EventBridge console
   - Create a new rule
   - Set the schedule (e.g., `rate(1 day)` or `cron(0 12 * * ? *)`)
   - Add the Lambda function as the target

3. **Usage**:
   - Upload images to your S3 bucket
   - The Lambda function will run at the scheduled times
   - It will:
     1. Get the oldest image from S3
     2. Validate it meets Instagram requirements
     3. Post it to Instagram
     4. Delete it from S3
     5. Log the results

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - All credentials are stored as environment variables
   - No hardcoded secrets in the code
   - The Lambda function runs in an isolated container
   - S3 bucket should have appropriate access controls
   - Instagram credentials are handled securely

5. **Free Tier Usage**:
   - AWS Lambda: 1M free requests per month

## End-to-End Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Instagram Auto Poster end-to-end:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **AWS Account** (for Lambda, S3, ECR, EventBridge)
- **Instagram Account** (username & password)
- **Docker** installed locally
- **Python 3.9+** (for local testing)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-auto-poster.git
cd instagram-auto-poster
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies (for local testing)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create and Configure AWS S3 Bucket
- Go to the AWS S3 console
- Click "Create bucket"
- Name your bucket (e.g., `my-instagram-images`)
- Leave all other settings as default or adjust as needed
- Upload a few test images to the bucket

### 5. Set Up AWS IAM User for Programmatic Access
- Go to AWS IAM console
- Create a new user with programmatic access
- Attach the following policies:
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess` (or restrict to your bucket)
  - `AWSLambda_FullAccess`
  - `AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess`
  - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
- Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

### 6. Create a `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
```
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
```

### 7. Build and Push Docker Image to AWS ECR
- Go to AWS ECR console
- Create a new repository (e.g., `instagram-auto-poster`)
- Authenticate Docker to your ECR:
  ```bash
  aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com
  ```
- Build and tag the Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t instagram-auto-poster .
  docker tag instagram-auto-poster:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/instagram-auto-poster:latest
  ```
- Push the image:
  ```bash
  docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/instagram-auto-poster:latest
  ```

### 8. Create Lambda Function from Container Image
- Go to AWS Lambda console
- Click "Create function"
- Choose "Container image"
- Enter a function name (e.g., `InstagramAutoPoster`)
- For Container image URI, use the ECR image URI you pushed
- Set environment variables from your `.env` file
- Set the handler to: `src.handlers.lambda_handler.lambda_handler`
- Set the timeout to at least 1 minute

### 9. Set Up EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) for Scheduling
- Go to AWS EventBridge console
- Create a new rule
- Choose "Schedule" and set your desired cron or rate expression (e.g., `cron(0 12 * * ? *)` for every day at noon UTC)
- Add the Lambda function as the target

### 10. Test the Setup
- Upload a test image to your S3 bucket
- Trigger the Lambda manually or wait for the schedule
- Check Instagram for the new post
- Check S3 to confirm the image was deleted

### 11. Troubleshooting
- Check Lambda logs in AWS CloudWatch for errors
- Ensure your IAM user has the correct permissions
- Make sure your Instagram credentials are correct and not locked by Instagram
- Ensure your images meet Instagram's requirements (see validator)

### 12. Local Testing (Optional)
You can run the handler locally for testing:
```bash
python -m src.handlers.lambda_handler
```

---

## Manual Steps Required
- AWS account setup (S3, Lambda, ECR, EventBridge)
- Instagram account setup
- IAM user creation and permissions
- Docker installation and ECR authentication
- Environment variable configuration
- Manual upload of images to S3

---

## FAQ
- **Q:** Why do I need to use my own Instagram credentials?
  **A:** Instagram does not provide a public API for posting; automation requires your credentials. Use a dedicated account for safety.
- **Q:** Can I use this for business/brand accounts?
  **A:** Yes, but be aware of Instagram's automation policies.
- **Q:** Is this free?
  **A:** All AWS services used have a free tier. Stay within limits to avoid charges.

Conversation Log

User: I'd like to create a script that would take the least-recent taken photo from photos that the user already uploaded to some storage, and post it on instagram, then delete the photo from S3. The script should run at specific times per day. It should handle failures and exceptions.
It should scan the images if any images were added to determine if all images are within Instagram requirements, or otherwise print an error.
The script should be well structured (separate files, Single Responsibility principle for functions and all other good coding principles...), and contain unit tests.
Feel free to suggest alternatives, but I was thinking of making a Python script which uses intagrapi, packing it in a Docker container, run on AWS lambda and use its schedualer, and use S3 as the storage that the user will upload the images to.
The whole thing should only use free tiers, no payment required.
Make sure everything is safe and secure (e.g. the container's content isn't exposed, no unsafe code or exposed tokens or account info...)
Also describe and document the process as you go, as I want to upload the project to Github/Medium.
Overall I have a bunch of images I'd like to upload daily (or a few times a day at specific hours) to instagram but I don't want to do it manually.
Bonus: Use some free AI (or at least free for limited use as I don't plan on uploading a lot of images) to auto analyse the picture before uploading and add a description and tags to the post that will describe the picture and attract the most possible views.
Thanks!

- If you encounter any issues or need to clarify a step, let me know. I will update both the README and the correspondence log with every new query and answer, so future users have a seamless experience.
- If you want to test locally, ensure your `.env` is set and run the handler as described.

**What I can't do automatically and need your help with:**
- AWS account setup, IAM, S3, ECR, Lambda, and EventBridge configuration (as described in the README).
- Instagram account management and credential input.
- Docker/ECR authentication (requires your AWS credentials).
- Uploading images to your S3 bucket.

**How to keep the correspondence log updated:**
- Every time you ask a new question or make a request, I will append both your query and my response to `correspondence.txt`.

This error is related to building the `Pillow` package (and possibly other packages) on Windows, and is not specific to your code. It is a known issue with some versions of Pillow and pip/setuptools on Windows, often due to missing build tools or a bug in the package's setup script.

**How to Fix:**

### 1. Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel
First, make sure you have the latest versions of pip, setuptools, and wheel, as older versions can cause build issues:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 2. Install Pillow from a Wheel (Recommended for Windows)
Instead of building from source, install Pillow from a pre-built wheel:

```powershell
pip install --only-binary=:all: Pillow==10.2.0
```

Then, try installing the rest of the requirements:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
```

### 3. If You Still Get Errors
- Make sure you have the Microsoft C++ Build Tools installed (required for building some Python packages from source).
- You can download them from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

---

### **README Update**
I will add a troubleshooting section to the README with these steps for Windows users.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the above commands in your terminal.
2. If you encounter any further errors, copy the error message here and I will help you resolve it.
3. I will update the correspondence log and README with these troubleshooting steps.

Would you like me to update the README and correspondence log now?

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

```powershell
pip install --only-binary=:all: Pillow==10.2.0
```

```powershell

ERROR: No matching distribution found for Pillow==10.2.0

---

**Cursor**

This error means that the specific version `Pillow==10.2.0` is not available as a pre-built wheel for your platform (Windows, Python version). However, newer versions (10.4.0, 11.0.0, etc.) are available and should work fine for your use case.

**Solution:**
1. **Update the version of Pillow in your `requirements.txt` to a version that is available as a wheel, such as `10.4.0`.**
2. **Install again:**
   ```powershell
   pip install --only-binary=:all: Pillow==10.4.0
   ```

3. **Then, install the rest of the requirements (excluding Pillow):**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
   ```

4. **Or, update `requirements.txt` and install everything at once:**
   - Change the line in `requirements.txt` from:
     ```
     Pillow==10.2.0
     ```
     to
     ```
     Pillow==10.4.0
     ```
   - Then run:
     ```powershell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

You are now encountering a new error related to the installation of the `pydantic` package (a dependency of `instagrapi`). The error message:

> This package requires Rust and Cargo to compile extensions. Install it through the system's package manager or via https://rustup.rs/

**This means:**
- The version of `pydantic` being installed (2.5.2) requires the Rust toolchain to build some of its components.
- On Windows, this is not installed by default.

---

## Solution

### 1. **Install Rust and Cargo**

- Go to: https://rustup.rs/
- Download and run the installer for Windows.
- Follow the prompts to install Rust and Cargo.
- After installation, restart your terminal (or run `refreshenv` if you use Chocolatey).

Or, you can install via PowerShell:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe -OutFile rustup-init.exe
Start-Process .\rustup-init.exe -Wait
```
Then follow the prompts in the installer.

### 2. **Verify Installation**
After installation, run:
```powershell
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
Both should print a version number.

### 3. **Retry Installing Requirements**
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

   rmdir /s /q .venv
   ```

2. **Install Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12:**
   - Download from:  
     - [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31013/)
     - [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)
     - [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/)
   - Install it and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

3. **Create a new virtual environment with the supported Python version:**
   ```powershell
   py -3.11 -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   *(Replace `-3.11` with the version you installed, e.g., `-3.10` or `-3.12`.)*

4. **Reinstall requirements:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## README & Correspondence Update

I will add a troubleshooting section to the README and correspondence log about Python version compatibility.

**Summary:**  
`instagrapi` and its dependencies do not support Python 3.13 yet. Use Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 for this project.

Let me know if you need help installing or switching Python versions! I will update the documentation and log accordingly.

## Troubleshooting: Python Version Compatibility

If you see errors like:

> TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'
> ERROR: Failed building wheel for pydantic-core
> ERROR: Failed to build installable wheels for some pyproject.toml based projects (pydantic-core)

This is likely because you are using Python 3.13 or newer, which is not yet supported by `instagrapi` and its dependencies.

**Solution:**
1. Uninstall your current virtual environment (if any):
   ```powershell
   deactivate
   rmdir /s /q .venv
   ```
2. Install Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Create a new virtual environment with the supported Python version:
   ```powershell
   py -3.11 -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   *(Replace `-3.11` with the version you installed, e.g., `-3.10` or `-3.12`.)*
4. Reinstall requirements:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

```

```plaintext

User: pip install -r requirements.txt (error: TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard' ... ERROR: Failed building wheel for pydantic-core)

Assistant: This is a compatibility issue between Python 3.13 and the pydantic/instagrapi packages. Solution: Use Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12. Uninstall your current virtual environment, install a supported Python version, create a new venv, and reinstall requirements. This troubleshooting is now included in the README.

```

The README now includes a troubleshooting section for Python version compatibility, and the correspondence log has been updated with your latest issue and the solution.

**Summary of what to do:**
1. Uninstall your current virtual environment.
2. Install Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (not 3.13).
3. Create a new virtual environment with the supported Python version.
4. Reinstall requirements.

If you need help with any of these steps, let me know! I will continue to update the documentation and correspondence log for you and future users.

**User**

That's not the issue, you have old versions in your requirements file. For example - instagrapi latest is 2.1.5

Go over all the first 4 lines of requirements file only, and use the latest version available for each dep (the latest that should work with the rest)
